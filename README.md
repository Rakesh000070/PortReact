## 📌 About This Project

> In a world where **first impressions are digital**, your portfolio should speak **before you do**.

**PortReact** is not just a codebase — it's my **personal brand** online. Designed to be minimal, fast, and memorable, it reflects who I am, what I do, and where I’m headed.
